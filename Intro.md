# Introduction #

Please don't sue me for trying to fix a broken tool.
As noted, the original code is mostly non-functional in Chrome 22+. Theres nothing quite like it, so after poking at the repo, I decided to give a whack at fixing the thing. And, adding some stuff that I always wanted.

The core project was originally released by **neil.fraser** as the [Google Site Spider](https://code.google.com/p/google-site-spider/)
[Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/site-spider/ddlodfbcplakmddhdlffebcggbbighda?hl=en)

This is a fork of that project. Slightly different output format, and updated to the new manifest version.

New features include:
  * The ability to pause the spider.
  * The ability to stop the spider from the results page.

Major bug fix:
  * It works in Chrome again.
